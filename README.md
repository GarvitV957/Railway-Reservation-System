## General info
We have created a web application where a user can register and login with required information. After login the user can enter information such as source railway station, destination railway station, date, time etc. and check the availability of seats in the displayed list of trains available. Our web application also facilitates online verification of tickets during the journey just by using the seat number and a specific id generated for that journey. We have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and MYSQL to develop our project.
